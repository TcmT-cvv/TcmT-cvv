# CLAUDE.md

## Repository Overview

This is a **GitHub profile repository** (`TcmT-cvv/TcmT-cvv`). Its sole purpose is to display a personal profile README on the GitHub user page for [TcmT-cvv](https://github.com/TcmT-cvv).

## Structure

```
/
├── README.md    # GitHub profile content (displayed on the user's GitHub profile page)
└── CLAUDE.md    # This file — guidance for AI assistants
```

## Key Facts

- **No source code, build tools, tests, or dependencies** exist in this repository.
- The only functional file is `README.md`, which GitHub renders on the owner's profile page.
- The default branch is `master`.

## Conventions

- `README.md` should contain valid **GitHub-flavored Markdown**.
- GitHub supports HTML, images, badges, and emoji in profile READMEs.
- Keep content appropriate for a public-facing profile page.

## How to Make Changes

1. Edit `README.md` with the desired profile content.
2. Commit directly to `master` (no build or test step required).
3. Changes appear immediately on the GitHub profile page after push.

## For AI Assistants

- When editing `README.md`, preserve any intentional formatting or structure the owner has set up.
- Do not add build tooling, CI/CD, or package management unless explicitly requested.
- This repo is documentation-only; treat it as a single-file project.
